# Hi, I’m Malik 👋  
**Full-Stack Developer**

I build and maintain production systems that handle real traffic, real data, and real business constraints — from high-volume lead funnels to data-heavy platforms in healthcare, retail, and e-commerce.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

I’ve worked across multiple stacks depending on the problem, team, and scale:

- **Frontend:** React, Angular  
- **Backend:** .NET, Node.js  
- **Databases:** SQL-based systems  
- **Architecture & Tools:** REST APIs, system integrations, automation pipelines, Git-based workflows  

I’m comfortable moving across the stack — from UI and dashboards to backend logic, data flows, and performance-sensitive systems.

## 🛒 Current Build: Shopify Automation Platform

I’m developing a tool for **Shopify store owners** that automates and accelerates product management:

- Automatically add products using:
  - A single product link
  - AI-assisted extraction
  - Structured JSON input
- Auto price updates based on competitor websites
- Detailed previews and controls to help store owners make informed decisions  

The goal is to remove repetitive manual work and give store owners better visibility and control over their catalog and pricing strategy.
